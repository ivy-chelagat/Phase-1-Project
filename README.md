# Aircraft Risk Analysis for Business Expansion  

## Project Overview  
As our company explores entry into the aviation industry, this project analyzes aviation accident data (1962–2023) from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to guide safe and strategic aircraft investments. 
By identifying risk patterns across aircraft types, accident causes, and flight phases, we provide data-driven recommendations to minimize operational risks.

## Key Objectives  
1. **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess historical accident records for analysis.  
2. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate accidents by aircraft type, engine design, location, and severity.  
3. **Safety Trends:** Identify low-risk aircraft models and high-risk scenarios (e.g., weather, pilot error).  
4. **Actionable Insights:** Deliver 3 strategic recommendations for informed investment decision
   
## Tools and Technologies
Python: Data cleaning, analysis and visual exploration (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Tableau: Dashboard creation and presentation of key insights for stakeholders

## Key Insights
Aircraft Type Matters: Aircraft with turbine engines show better safety performance compared to piston-powered models.
Accident Phases: Many incidents occur outside takeoff and landing — especially during cruise and maneuvering, pointing to training gaps.
Weather Is a Major Risk Factor: Poor weather conditions and incomplete data frequently contribute to accidents, highlighting the need for better preparedness and reporting.

## Recommendations
Invest in Aircraft with Proven Safety Records:
Focus on reliable models like Cessna with turboprop or modern reciprocating engines that offer solid performance and lower risk.
Enhance Full-Phase Pilot Training:
Expand training to include less-emphasized flight phases like cruising and maneuvering, where many avoidable accidents occur.
Strengthen Weather Preparedness:
Equip aircraft with advanced weather detection tools, provide weather-specific training, and encourage complete, accurate reporting to reduce weather-related incidents

## Conclusion
This analysis shows that aviation safety is influenced by aircraft design, pilot readiness, and environmental factors.
By understanding these patterns, our company can invest in the aviation sector more confidently and responsibly — reducing risk while enabling sustainable growth.
